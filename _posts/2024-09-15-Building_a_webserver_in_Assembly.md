In this post, we will explore how to build a simple web server in assembly that can handle HTTP requests and serve a file in Linux.

## Introduction

Building a web server in assembly language is a great way to dive deep into how low-level socket programming works. In this project, we will set up a server that listens for incoming connections, accepts them, and responds with the contents of a file. For this example, we will serve a file called `flag` from the `/home/ffletch/` directory.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before proceeding:

- **`gcc` or any assembler tool like `as` (GNU Assembler)**  
- **`ld` (GNU Linker)**  
- **`strace` for debugging (optional)**

Ensure you have created a `flag` file at `/home/ffletch/flag` or wherever for the server to serve. You can do this by running:

```bash
echo "This is the flag file content!" > /home/ffletch/flag
```
## Understanding System Calls

In Linux, system calls are how user-space programs interact with the kernel. In assembly, system calls are made by setting the appropriate system call number in the `rax` register and executing the `syscall` instruction. Arguments are passed through registers such as `rdi`, `rsi`, and `rdx`.

Here are some system calls we will use:
1. **`socket()`**: Create an endpoint for communication.
2. **`bind()`**: Associate the socket with a local address (IP/port).
3. **`listen()`**: Mark the socket to accept incoming connections.
4. **`accept()`**: Extract the first connection on the queue of pending connections.
5. **`read()`**: Read data from a file descriptor (like a socket).
6. **`write()`**: Write data to a file descriptor (such as a socket).
7. **`close()`**: Close the file descriptor, freeing the associated resources.

## System Call Number Reference

In your assembly code, you directly use system call numbers in the `rax` register to invoke system calls via the `syscall` instruction. Here is a table mapping the system call names to their corresponding numbers on the x86_64 Linux architecture:

| System Call | Number (`rax`) | Description                                         |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `socket`    | 41             | Create an endpoint for communication.               |
| `bind`      | 49             | Bind a socket to an address.                        |
| `listen`    | 50             | Listen for incoming connections on a socket.        |
| `accept`    | 43             | Accept a connection on a socket.                    |
| `read`      | 0              | Read data from a file descriptor.                   |
| `write`     | 1              | Write data to a file descriptor.                    |
| `close`     | 3              | Close a file descriptor.                            |
| `exit`      | 60             | Terminate the calling process.                      |

## How to Compile and Run

Hereâ€™s how you can compile and run the assembly web server step-by-step:

### Step 1: Compile the Assembly Code

To compile the assembly code, you will use the GNU Assembler (`as`) and Linker (`ld`).

```bash
as -o server.o server.s && ld -o server server.o
```

This will create an executable named `server`.

### Step 2: Run the Server

Once compiled, run the server to start listening on port 80.

```bash
sudo ./server
```

You will need `sudo` because port 80 is a privileged port, and you will only be able to bind to it with elevated permissions.

### Step 3: Verify Server is Running

You can use `netstat` or `ss` to check that the server is indeed listening on port 80:

```bash
sudo ss -tuln | grep :80
```

## Interacting with the Server using Curl

Now that the web server is up and running, you can interact with it using `curl` to make HTTP requests. Follow the steps below to fetch the contents of the file.

### Example 1: Fetch the File

You can use `curl` to send a GET request to the server. Open a new terminal and run the following command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:80
```

If everything is working correctly, the server will respond with the contents of the file `/home/ffletch/flag`.

### Example 2: Save the Output to a File

You can use `curl` to fetch the content and save it to a file:

```bash
curl http://localhost:80 -o output.txt
cat output.txt
This is the flag file content!
```

This will save the response to `output.txt`.

### Step 3: Debugging with `strace`

If you're encountering issues, you can use `strace` to trace the system calls being made by the server. This can help you understand where things might be going wrong.

```bash
sudo strace -f -e trace=open,read,write ./server
```

With `strace`, you'll see the system calls related to opening the file, reading its contents, and writing the response back to the client.

## Conclusion

This project walks you through building a simple web server in assembly that listens on port 80, accepts connections, and serves a file in response to HTTP requests. By interacting with the server using `curl` and tracing the system calls with `strace`, you can gain a deep understanding of low-level socket programming and file serving in assembly. We also covered various ways to interact with the server using `curl`, including saving output to a file.
