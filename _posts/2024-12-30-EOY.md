## Goodbye 2024

This year brought some unexpected recognition for my projects. The "Cheap Yellow Display" project caught attention in places I never imagined—Adafruit’s blog, their Python on Microcontrollers Newsletter, and even across several YouTube channels. Seeing it picked up by HackerBoxes as part of their Penetration Test Toolkit was a personal highlight. It’s surreal to think something that started as a fun experiment turned into something people are using and talking about.

Beyond that, diving deeper into the ESP32 Marauder ecosystem was rewarding. Collaborating with the community, seeing write-ups from blogs like Deca's Foxhole and Judz.net, and even being featured in Mobile-hacker.com’s breakdown of the Marauder toolset made the hours of tinkering worth it.

Still, 2024 wasn’t just about projects and mentions—it was a year of learning and experimenting. Whether it was troubleshooting code or discovering new tools, it felt good to keep exploring and building.

Now, with 2025 just around the corner, I’m hoping for more of the same—learning, creating, and maybe even surprising myself again. Thanks to everyone who engaged, shared, or just followed along. Here’s to another year of making things happen.

Goodbye, 2024.
